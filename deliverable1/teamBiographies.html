<p>Jodi Jang is a passionate third year student in the Computer Science Software Engineering
 Specialist Co-op Program at the University of Toronto Scarborough. She is fluent is multiple 
 programming languages including Java, Python, and C, and she has used these programming 
 languages in various projects. Additionally, Jodi has experience using Android Studio to create
 user-friendly interfaces and creating Bash scripts to automate laborious processes. Furthermore,
 she has strong knowledge of software concepts including Object-Oriented design and various 
 design patterns. Jodi has gained hands-on programming experience designing algorithms, creating
 software, and writing technical documents while working at Thales Canada. Some of the projects 
 she worked on includes creating software to implement a post-processing procedure for analysis 
 and comparison of sensor data and developing a procedure for benchmarking computer performance 
 while running a program. She used strong verbal and written communication skills to present, 
 analyze, and document these projects.</p>

<p>Tia Jang is currently a third year student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, 
studying Computer Science and specializing in Software Engineering. She has more than 
four years of programming experience, including Java, C, C++, and Python languages. 
Over the years, she worked independently and collaborated with teams to produce a variety 
of programs. Using Android Studio, she collaborated with a team to code an interactive 
shopping application that featured object-oriented design and user-friendly layouts. 
Most recently she has interned at Thales as a research engineer, where she designed and 
implemented an autoexposure algorithm for a camera. This algorithm ensured the cameraâ€™s 
exposure was correctly controlled to take well-exposed images in a dynamic environment, 
and applied research of image quality and multi-threading. She communicated effectively 
with a team and through comprehensive technical reports. She is passionate about applying 
her skills and learning new skills to provide innovative solutions to challenges. </p>

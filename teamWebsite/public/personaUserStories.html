                                                Victor Chang is a 33-year old
                                                restaurant owner of three
                                                restaurants in suburban GTA. His
                                                restaurants are very busy during
                                                peak hours, and many people
                                                order his popular dishes, but he
                                                wants to encourage more
                                                customers to come during
                                                non-peak hours, and to try more
                                                food from his menus. He owns a
                                                laptop and is not very
                                                comfortable using this
                                                technology. His primary language
                                                is Chinese, so he often
                                                navigates English websites using
                                                the visuals. Wifi is provided
                                                for staff members in his
                                                restaurants.

                                                Bob Smith has an active family
                                                with his three younger children
                                                who are picky eaters; they live
                                                in suburban Scarborough. As a
                                                result of this, he is loyal to a
                                                few restaurants and frequents
                                                them often. Bob keeps his
                                                children engaged with
                                                interesting events/activities.
                                                He likes to save money so that
                                                they can use it towards other
                                                things for the future. As a busy
                                                parent, he does not have very
                                                much time to deal with the
                                                nuances with technology; because
                                                of that, he wants to earn his
                                                rewards without much hassle. He
                                                has a smartphone and only uses
                                                its basic functions.

                                                Charity Galvan is a 28-year-old
                                                who lives on a farm in Markham.
                                                She has heard of the variety in
                                                restaurants back in the city,
                                                but she does not want to go
                                                during rush hour periods or
                                                weekends, since the drive is
                                                already long. Her job makes her
                                                schedule very flexible, so she
                                                can go whenever she wants to.
                                                She does not care for games, but
                                                if there are good rewards
                                                involved then she is happy; she
                                                is motivated when she sees
                                                progress towards rewards. She is
                                                comfortable using her smartphone
                                                and is environmentally friendly,
                                                so she would prefer to have
                                                electronic copies of her rewards
                                                that she can redeem in store.

                            University of Toronto Scarborough, studying Computer
                            Science and specializing in Software Engineering.
                            She has more than four years of programming
                            experience, including Java, C, C++, and Python
                            languages. Over the years, she worked independently
                            and collaborated with teams to produce a variety of
                            programs. Using Android Studio, she collaborated
                            with a team to code an interactive shopping
                            application that featured object-oriented design and
                            user-friendly layouts. Most recently she has

                            designed and implemented an autoexposure algorithm
                            for a camera. This algorithm ensured the cameraâ€™s
                            exposure was correctly controlled to take
                            well-exposed images in a dynamic environment, and
                            applied research of image quality and
                            multi-threading. She communicated effectively with a
                            team and through comprehensive technical reports.
                            She is passionate about applying her skills and
                            learning new skills to provide innovative solutions

                            third-year student who is specializing in software
                            engineering at University of Toronto Scarborough
                            campus. Junaid has worked in many projects and
                            gained experience in multiple languages such as
                            Java, Python and C#. Junaid gained interest in
                            computer science during high school where he started
                            learning on his own to develop his own projects.
                            Some of his most successful projects includes
                            implementing an interactive command line and
                            developing a 2D platform game. Junaid's 2D platform
                            game was a team project and consisted of
                            self-learning of unity and C# which took the
                            duration of a few months. The interactive command
                            line was also a project worked alongside 3 other
                            team members in an agile SDLC environment. Frequent
                            communication with team members and client was
                            necessary in ensuring a successful project. Junaid
                            hopes to continue developing more projects and
                            acquire more skill as an everlasting enthusiast for
                            technology.

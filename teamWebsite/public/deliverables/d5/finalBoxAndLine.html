                                For this deliverable, we introduced a new subcomponent called Data Access to contain the Database
                                Communication component. This new subcomponent decouples the Database Communication from Profile Management
                                and allows for it to be related indirectly. In addition, it allows for future components related to data
                                access to be introduced without affecting the other components directly. However, this subcomponent is still
                                a part of C)Backend as it resides in the backend of our system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, we changed the names of the Login Interface
                                in A)Restaurant User Interface and Login Page in B) Customer User Interface to Restaurant Owner Login Page and
                                Customer Login Page to help distinguish the two interfaces. We changed the names and kept them separate because
                                even though they are very similar they function differently and belong to different subsystems.

                            <p>
                                In Deliverable 3, the frontend components all shared the same backend communication,
                                both on the A) Restaurant User Interface and the B) Customer Interface. In Deliverable 4,
                                we decoupled these features by creating more specific backend communication components.
                                That is, each feature has its own backend communication. Thus, we minimized coupling in
                                our current system diagram.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We introduced the subcomponents to group together similar components. For example,
                                we introduced the Profile Management subcomponent in the C) Backend which contains the
                                components User Authentication, User Profile Management, Restaurant Profile Management,
                                and Customer Profile Management. These components are all grouped together since they relate
                                to the management of profiles in the system. In addition, User Profile Management serves as a parent
                                component, while Restaurant Profile Management and Customer Profile Management inherit from it.
                                Thus, with the introduction of subcomponents with some inheritance, we maximized cohesion in our
                                current system diagram.

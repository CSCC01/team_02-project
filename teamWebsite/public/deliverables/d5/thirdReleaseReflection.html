						<strong>Changes to the Product Backlog</strong>
						<p>
						Our product backlog changed throughout the last three sprints after 
						conversations with our client and eliminating stories due to time constraints.
						</p>
						<p>
						Changes to our user stories relating to bingo board expiration dates occurred
						after conversations with our client. Our original plan had a 5x5 bingo 
						board and an expiration date for the entire board. After discussing with 
						our client, they mentioned that it would be unfeasible for a customer to 
						complete 25 goals, depending on the expiration date chosen by the 
						restaurant owner. They suggested having individual expiration dates for 
						goals and rewards. While our team was  discussing the implementation of 
						this feature, we discovered many problems with it. Some of these problems 
						included what would happen to the completion status of a completed goal 
						if it were to expire, and how a restaurant owner could feasibly maintain 
						the expiry dates of 25 goals and 12 rewards. We came up with a solution 
						to have the option to have smaller, 3x3 or 4x4, bingo boards with 
						expiration dates, and discussed this idea with our client. After receiving
						their approval, we modified our backlog to reflect these changes.
						</p>
						<p>
						An additional story relating to the clearing of a customer bingo board once
						the customer completed the entire bingo board was added after meeting with 
						our client. They mentioned that the board should be cleared once the 
						customer completed the entire board, and thus we modified our backlog to 
						add this user story.
						</p>
						<p>
						Two of our user stories were removed from our backlog due to time 
						constraints on the project. The stories that were removed were related to 
						the friend competition aspect of our bingo board. We decided to remove this
						feature as it was not explicitly asked for by the client; they were 
						included because we thought it would add a more gamified aspect to our 
						loyalty program, however, our product meets the client requirements without
						this feature. These stories were also the lowest priority.

						A difficulty that we encountered occurred after our team discussed 
						integrating the feature to allow restaurant owners to choose individual 
						expiry dates for goals and rewards on their bingo board. This feature was 
						suggested by our client, as they did not think having an expiration date 
						for a 5x5 board was a good idea, as customers may not be able to complete 
						25 goals before the expiration date. While discussing the implementation 
						of this feature we discovered many problems with it. Some of these problems
						included what would happen to the completion status of a completed goal if 
						it were to expire and how a restaurant can feasibly maintain the expiry 
						dates of 25 goals and 12 rewards. 
						</p>
						<p>
						We came up with the idea that a restaurant owner could choose a smaller 3x3
						board with an expiry date for the entire board, and brought up this idea 
						with the client. They agreed this was a good solution, and thus our 
						difficulty was resolved.

							We did not have to use our contingency plan for the past 3 sprints; no
							team members dropped out, were sick, consistently missed meetings, or 
							were academically dishonest. As a result of this, we did not have to 
							use our contingency plan or come up with new solutions.
							</p>
							<p>
							We tried to complete as much work as possible before the project 
							deadline by assigning a higher number of story points for each sprint. 
							As a result of the higher project velocity, some stories had to be 
							pushed to following sprints. However, this did not affect our plan 
							drastically, due to our just-in-time planning strategy for each sprint.

						At the end of Deliverable 4, our team’s release included a lots of implemented 
						functionality. Restaurant users and customers have dedicated interfaces to sign 
						up to make an account and login. Restaurant users have a customizable profile, 
						and can choose to create, view, and remove custom goals on a dedicated interface.
						They can edit and save changes to their bingo board with pre-defined and customized goals, 
						as well as rewards from a pre-defined list. For customers, when they log in they can view
						a list of restaurants with visible profiles, and choose to view the full profile or the 
						restaurant’s bingo board.
						</p>
						<p>
						By the end of Deliverable 5, our team’s latest release includes improvement on our previous
						work, as well as many more implemented features. Restaurant users can now customize rewards 
						on a dedicated interface, choose from 3 sizes of game boards, set an expiration date for their 
						game board, and plan a future game board. When their current game board’s expiration date passes,
						it is replaced with their future board. They have an interface where they can scan customer QR 
						codes or type in unique codes to verify when goals and rewards are completed. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Customers can now view information about the restaurant, “favourite” restaurants, and view 
						“favourite” restaurants on an interface. The customer’s “View Game Board” interface was redesigned
						to show achievement paths, QR codes, and rewards corresponding with each goal. The board changes
						to show progress and completed achievement paths. Customers can also view their earned and redeemed
						rewards; earned rewards have QR codes for redemption and redeemed rewards show the date of redemption.

					Deliverable 5 differed from Deliverable 4 in terms of progress and end result. At the end of 
					Deliverable 4, our team’s release included key functionality but no redemption or expiration date 
					features. As highlighted in the ‘Project Progression’ section, the release at the end of Deliverable 
					5 includes full functionality. Deliverable 4 had just a singular 5x5 game board for restaurant users
					to customize; after speaking with the PickEasy team, we implemented their feedback so that restaurant 
					users have the option of different sizes of game boards. We added an expiry date for the board and an
					interface to plan a future board allows our gamified to be fully updatable and usable over time.
					</p>
					<p>
					Since this was the final deliverable, our team tried to get as much work done as possible in the 
					first two sprints, as we knew we would need to allot time for the report and final adjustments before 
					the final release; we also wanted to finish work as soon as possible to account for potential bug fixes.
					Because of this, the project velocities for these sprints were much higher than that of Deliverable 4. 
					As a result of the higher velocities, for these sprints there were some story points that were not
					completed and needed to be carried over to the next sprint.

					Unit tests are grouped based on the feature being implemented. Each of our user stories relate 
					to a specific testable feature; once the code is completed, the author will make a unit test
					suite. This suite covers expected cases, edge cases, and routing, where applicable; all unit 
					test methods have titles that reflect the test that is being run, as well as a header to 
					describe the test. This ensures backend functionality works as expected. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Frontend features that cannot be tested with unit testing, such as visuals changing on the 
					frontend are tested with test cases. Like unit tests, these test suites are grouped according
					to the feature they are for; these features are determined from user stories. The test case
					files include the category/grouping the test corresponds to, test description, steps to 
					complete the test, expected result, and whether the test passes or fails. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Together, the unit tests and test cases provide proof that the user story was implemented 
					correctly; this means it passes acceptance criteria and handles edge cases appropriately. 
					During our peer reviews, we ensure to check our team member’s unit tests and test cases to 
					ensure they pass, and to ensure that all expected and edge cases are documented.

							The following outlines the questions we asked our client, the answer
							we received, and how we implemented their feedback.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<strong>July 27, 2020</strong>
								<li>
									<p>
									<strong>Q:</strong>
									What do you think about the layout of the customer view bingo 
									board page and the highlighted achievement paths? Do we need a 
									help button for clarity?
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>A:</strong>
									The client said that the layout of the customer view bingo 
									board page and the highlighted achievement paths were intuitive
									and a help button was not needed.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>How we Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
									We incorporated this feedback by not including a help button.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>				
									<p>
									<strong>Q:</strong>
									Should the goals on the customer bingo board reset after an 
									achievement path is complete or after the entire board has been
									completed?
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>A:</strong>
									The client said the board should be cleared after the entire 
									bingo board has been completed.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>How we Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
									We incorporated this feedback by adding a function to clear the
									board when a customer has completed the entire board.
									</p>
								</li>							
								<li>				
									<p>
									<strong>Q:</strong>
									What do you think of the idea for restaurants to be able to 
									create a 3x3 board with an expiration date?
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>A:</strong>
									The client said the 3x3 board idea would work, as 9 goals to 
									complete is more feasible than 25. They also mentioned they 
									would like there to be incentive to complete the entire board.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>How we Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
									We incorporated this feedback by letting the restaurant owner 
									choose the size of their bingo board; the options for sizes are
									3x3, 4x4, and 5x5. They can also choose the expiry date for 
									their board. We were unable to complete the feature to offer an
									additional reward once the entire board was completed due to 
									time restrictions; however, this could easily be appended if 
									the client chose to proceed with our project.

						<strong>Feedback from the Client and how we Incorporated their Feedback</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
								<strong>Feedback 1:</strong>
								The client did not like the lack of words and visuals on the customer 
								view board page. They especially did not like the ‘x’ to show 
								uncompleted goals.
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>How We Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
								We incorporated this feedback by changing the image on uncompleted 
								goals to a hamburger icon, so that it looked more appealing than 
								the ‘x’. Additionally, we added a drop-down menu per each reward, 
								that shows a list of goals that the user would need to complete to 
								achieve the reward. This resolves the issue of lack of words, while
								still maintaining readability on a mobile device.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
								<strong>Feedback 2:</strong>
								The client suggested that each individual goal and reward have an 
								expiry date instead of the entire board, as completing 25 goals is 
								not feasible.
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>How we Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
								We discussed this idea further with our client after realizing 
								problems with it. Some of these problems include what would happen 
								to the completion status of a completed goal if it were to expire 
								and how a restaurant can feasibly maintain the expiry dates of 25 
								goals and 12 rewards. We brought up the idea that a restaurant 
								owner could choose a smaller 3x3 board with an expiry date for 
								the entire board. They agreed this was a good solution, so we 
								implemented a feature that allows the restaurant user to choose 
								between a 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 board with a single expiry date.

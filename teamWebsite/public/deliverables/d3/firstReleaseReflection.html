                            Two user stories were added: one for restaurant owner login and one for customer
							login. This addition was made after speaking with our clients, as they confirmed 
							it is a feature they want.  Our sprint backlog also changed; we decided during our 
							sprint that adding and removing a singular goal from a restaurant profile should be
							done in a later sprint when we implement customized goals. We edited our user stories
							to reflect the updated functionality: adding goals from a pre-made selection to the 
							user’s interface and profile, and clearing the user’s goals on the interface.
							<li>
                            For each user story in the Backlog, there are the following details:
							</li>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Priorities</b> are labelled at the top of each card.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Groupings of user stories</b> are shown through the labels.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Story points</b> are shown in brackets in the user story
										titles.
									</li>
									<li>
										1 story point = 2 hours
									</li>
								</ul>

							Deliverable 2 consisted of a collection of personas and user stories with assigned priorities. 
							Progressing to Deliverable 3, we used the user stories to develop a product backlog. As mentioned, 
							new user stories were added between Deliverable 2 and 3 after speaking with our clients. We used the user story 
							priorities to select user stories for our first sprint. After completing the sprint backlog, our project progressed 
							to a simple web interface that allowed users to add and remove goals from our premade selection.

							For the first half of the sprint we followed our plans exactly. However, we faced difficulties when we edited 
							our sprint backlog; we overcame this with a team meeting where we clarified tasks and reassigned tasks.
							An instance when we used our contingency plan 
							occurred when a team member went on vacation and was unable to work for two days of the sprint. As mentioned in 
							our contingency plan, the team redistributed tasks to account for this.

							<p>
								We added changes to system components according to the feedback 
								we received from our TA after the last deliverable. As seen in Figure 2, the
								frontend components all shared the same backend communication, both on the A) Website Interface 
								and the B) Application Interface. In this deliverable (Figure 1), we decoupled these features 
								by creating more specific backend communication components. That is, each feature has its own backend communication.
								Notice also in Figure 1 that some interfaces have been grouped together in subcomponents as they share many similarities.
								For example, in Figure 1 A) we have a subcomponent entitled Restaurant Profile Interfaces and inside we have Create Account 
								Page, Login Interface, Restaurant Profile Editor and Restaurant Owner Summary. Each of these components all relate to the
								Restaurant Profile, hence why they can be grouped together. However, the Goal and Reward Customization Page and the Bingo
								Board Editor components are not considered as a Restaurant Profile Interface, yet they are still important features of the
								Website Interface. Furthermore, we cleaned up the C) Backend. In Figure 1, we introduced changed the Database Management
								Systems subcomponent into the Profile Management subcomponent and placed User Authentication under this subcomponent.
								All the individual backend components now connect to the Profile Management subcomponent. We also User Management component as a parent component,
								which Restaurant Management and (the new) Customer Management components inherit from.
								The Friend Reward Comparison, Goal Completion Modifier, Reward Completion Modifier components no longer relate directly to
								the Database Communication but rather indirectly through other components as seen in Figure 1.

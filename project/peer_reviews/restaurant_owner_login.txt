styling issues mentioned by the auto formatter. Any issues that were mentioned by the auto

Anything not mentioned here is assumed have passed the review.

Functionality
-------------
- Usernames are case sensitive, this could be frustrating for users
- The title for login page "Login Here" could be better, "here" seems unnecessary 


Code
----
restaurant_profile_manager.py:
- set_new_profile() has conflicting return values
- get_user() has conflicting return values
- check_user_exists() does not mention the potential for an exception to be thrown in docstring
- Unclear on what UserMixin does for RestaurantProfileManager, provide a comment
- Unsure of whether or not get_user() truly requires username as param,
  already included in __init__()
- Unsure of whether or not set_new_profile() truly requires username as param,
